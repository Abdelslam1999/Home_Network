# Home_Network

## Objective

Creating a Home Network Using Cisco Packet Tracer

### Skills Learned


By creating this home network using Cisco Packet Tracer, I gained valuable insights into network design principles, device configuration, and troubleshooting techniques. The network provides a solid foundation for future expansions and enhancements, such as implementing advanced security measures, integrating IoT (Internet of Things) devices, and optimizing network performance.

In conclusion, this project not only allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting but also empowered me to build a reliable and efficient home network that meets the diverse connectivity needs of modern households.



### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]
- internet service provider: for the project to give the whole picture about how the network work from start to finish.
- cable modem: So we can change the connection type for the ISP from coaxial to Ethernet to connect to our router.
- Router: I integrated a Cisco router as the backbone of the network, responsible for managing traffic between different network segments and connecting to the Internet.
- Switches: Multiple switches were strategically placed to facilitate local area network (LAN) connectivity and ensure high-speed communication among devices within the same network segment.
- Firewall: Security is paramount, so I incorporated a firewall to protect the network from unauthorized access and potential threats.
- Server: A dedicated server was included for centralized data storage, file sharing, and network management tasks.
- smart Phones: To support VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) communication, IP phones were added to the network.


## Steps
Using Cisco Packet Tracer's intuitive interface, I carefully configured each device, ensuring proper addressing, routing, and security settings. I configured DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to automate IP address assignment and implemented VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) for network segmentation and enhanced security.
Throughout the process, I conducted a thourgh testing to verify the functionality and performance of the network. This involved testing connectivity between devices, verifying Internet access, assessing wireless coverage and signal strength, and evaluating security measures.
